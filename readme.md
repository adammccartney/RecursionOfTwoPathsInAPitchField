Recursion in a Pitch Field
==========================

Simple program that models the path traveled by individual pitches in a melody 
as they are transposed through a pitch field. 

Code has been generated from pseudocode, so the
comments *should* convey a detailed description of the idea and what's happening.

This is a test version that tries to generate a model of one path from an initial pitch.
It's buggy, at the moment it's returning a LNK2005 error due to some multiple definition 
that's proving tricky to find.
