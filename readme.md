Recursion in a Pitch Field
==========================

Simple program that models the path individual pitches in a melody 
as they are transposed through a pitch field. 

Code has been generated from pseudocode, so the
comments *should* convey a detailed description of the idea and what's happening.

This is a test version and currently buggy, 
at the moment it's returning a LNK2005 error due to some multiple definition that's proving tricky to find.
